Per [PyDis' Rule 5](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/rules), we are unable to assist with questions related to youtube-dl, commonly used by Discord bots to stream audio, as its use violates YouTube's Terms of Service.

For reference, this usage is covered by the following clauses in [YouTube's TOS](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms), as of 2018-05-25:
```
4A: You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without YouTube's prior written authorization, unless YouTube makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the Embeddable Player).
```
```
4C: You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself, the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.
```
