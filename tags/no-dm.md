**Can I send you a private message?**

No. We do not provide one-on-one tutoring - you can hire someone locally if you really need that. We also prefer that questions are answered in a public channel as it means that everyone else present is able to learn from them. If you're working with code that you are unable to disclose for any reason, you should try to make your question more general and write a separate, small piece of code to illustrate your problem.
